The server code in this repository is (supposed to be) a multi-threaded server. It is written in Python 3.5.1
and is adapted from code on Geeksforgeeks.com and from the Kurose/Ross Computer Networking textbook and its companion material,
as well as Python documentation.

Specific links for adapted material (besides the Kurose/Ross material):

The code was written using the IDLE IDE. 

Currently the server.py script seems to successfully send files via HTTP to the client, but the files' contents do not appear on
the screen. This is the current problem that I'm working on. 

This README will be updated in the future with more details regarding how to run and use the server.py script once some of the bugs
are worked out. 

(At least, that's my hope.)
